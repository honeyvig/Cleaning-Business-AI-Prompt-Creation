# Cleaning-Business-AI-Prompt-Creation
I'm looking for an experienced AI prompter, experienced with prompt libraries and where to source prompts for codes for websites, search engine optimization, SEO, and a range of other digital marketing activities. I wanted to be trained into becoming an AI prompter myself, so I'm looking for someone who can guide me long-term, starting immediately. The first project would be building a cleaning business in my local suburb for a friend, and we'll do that straight away. 
====================
To develop your skills as an AI prompter and start immediately on your cleaning business project, hereâ€™s how you can leverage Python for prompt creation, SEO optimization, and digital marketing activities while also guiding you long-term on AI prompting best practices.
Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

Install essential libraries for AI prompting and digital marketing analytics.

pip install openai requests beautifulsoup4

Step 2: Define Prompt Libraries and Practices

AI prompters often use structured libraries and models to craft effective prompts. Below is an example codebase to generate website content for a cleaning business using OpenAI's GPT models.

import openai

# OpenAI API Key
openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

# Example function to generate content for a cleaning business website
def generate_content(topic, target_audience="homeowners"):
    prompt = f"""
    Write professional website content for a cleaning business. The content should focus on:
    - Topic: {topic}
    - Target Audience: {target_audience}
    - Key Features: Affordable, eco-friendly, trustworthy services.
    - Include a call-to-action to book services online.
    """
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=500,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    homepage_content = generate_content("Homepage")
    print("Homepage Content:\n", homepage_content)

Step 3: Guidance on Prompt Libraries
Prominent Prompt Libraries

    Prompt Engineering Frameworks:
        LangChain: For complex workflows combining multiple prompts and responses.
        PromptPerfect: To optimize and refine prompts for better AI output.

    Community Resources:
        Awesome Prompting: A GitHub repository containing curated prompt examples for various applications.
        PromptBase: A marketplace to buy and sell pre-designed prompts.

Step 4: SEO Optimization Prompts

Use SEO-focused prompts to generate metadata, keywords, and blog ideas.

def generate_seo_content(topic, keywords):
    prompt = f"""
    Generate an SEO-friendly blog post for a cleaning business. 
    - Topic: {topic}
    - Keywords: {', '.join(keywords)}
    - Structure: Introduction, benefits, services overview, and conclusion.
    """
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=700,
        temperature=0.6
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example usage
seo_blog = generate_seo_content(
    topic="Why Eco-Friendly Cleaning Matters",
    keywords=["eco-friendly cleaning", "green cleaning products", "sustainable cleaning"]
)
print("SEO Blog:\n", seo_blog)

Step 5: Integrate into Marketing Activities
Email Marketing Prompts:

def generate_email_copy(service, discount):
    prompt = f"""
    Write a promotional email for a cleaning business.
    - Service: {service}
    - Offer: {discount}% discount for first-time customers.
    - Tone: Friendly and professional.
    - Call-to-Action: "Book Your First Cleaning Today!"
    """
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=300,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

email_copy = generate_email_copy("Deep Cleaning Services", 20)
print("Email Copy:\n", email_copy)

Step 6: Workflow for Becoming a Pro Prompter

    Study Real-World Applications:
        Work with pre-designed prompt libraries to understand structure and use cases.

        Experiment with different prompt templates for blogs, social media posts, and ads.

    Keep Learning:
        Follow blogs like OpenAI Blog and Towards Data Science for advancements in AI.

Step 7: Example First Task: Cleaning Business
